Plan of Action
1. Analyze Provided Links
Figma Design Link: Review the design for consistency, usability, and accessibility. Look for alignment issues, inconsistent spacing, color contrast, readability, and adherence to design principles.
Testing URLs: Use the given links to perform a thorough manual testing process. Check for usability issues, responsiveness, navigation flow, and any unexpected behaviors.
